## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- **Fonts**: Fira Code (monospace)
- **APIs**: Web Speech API (voice commands)
- **Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas for ML visualizations and games
- **No Frameworks**: Zero dependencies for maximum performance

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Terminal-First**: Everything accessible via keyboard
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
3. **Accessibility**: Voice commands + clickable UI for all users
4. **Performance**: Lightweight, fast loading, smooth animations
5. **Immersion**: Feels like a real operating system

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Optimized for desktop (1400px max-width)
- Scales gracefully on tablets
- Mobile-friendly terminal interface

## 🔒 Security Note

All "dangerous" commands (like `sudo rm -rf /`) are simulated and completely safe. They trigger fun easter eggs instead of actual system operations.
